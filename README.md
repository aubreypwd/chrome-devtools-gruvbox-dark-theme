# Gruvbox Dark Theme for Chrome Devtools (Fixed)

Gruvbox Dark is a retro groove color scheme for Chrome DevTools. This is a port
of the Vim version originally by [Pavel Pertsev](https://github.com/morhetz)
found [here](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

It was broke, so I forked it and fixed it for Chrome at version `50.0.2661.102 (64-bit)`.

## Installation

There is no Chrome App for this, so do the following:

1. Clone this repo somewhere where it can live, e.g. `~/.chrometools-gruvbox`
2. Goto Extensions in Chrome
3. Check "Developer Mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
5. Browse to the above folder, and you'll see "DevTools Theme: Gruvbox Dark (aubreypwd)" added
6. Open DevTools and goto Gear/Settings
7. Enable Experiments > Allow custom UI themes
8. Close and re-open Devtools
